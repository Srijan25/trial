Read above file and answer the question that was in that file while reading that para given in that file 
ChatGPT said:
I’ve read the entire file carefully and answered the questions based strictly on the given paragraph.

✅ Correct Answers
1. Which combination of metrics would have most likely detected the fraud earlier?
✔ High concentration of transactions under a single user ID, repeated STDR closures within 30–90 days, frequent KCC advances near sanction limits, and high cash receipt-to-crediting variance ratios

2. Why are customers with deactivated SMS alerts at higher risk of account fraud?
✔ They lack financial literacy and are not aware of the banking process
(Also implied in the case: pensioners, farmers, illiterate traders were targeted because they could not independently track transactions.)

3. CBS ID remaining mapped after transfer is best classified as:
✔ A critical control gap that enabled unauthorized transactions and obscured accountability

4. Most effective control to prevent misuse of another employee’s credentials:
✔ Implementing multi-factor authentication, session monitoring, and strict enforcement of non-sharing policies with automated logout after inactivity

5. Primary internal control weakness enabling the fraud for 11 years:
✔ Over-reliance on a single employee without effective segregation of duties, independent verification, and periodic rotation

If you want, I can also:

Explain why each wrong option is incorrect (useful for exams), or

Convert this into exam-ready justification points for banking/finance interviews or internal vigilance cases.
