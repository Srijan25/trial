Chandapur Branch of ABC Bank, a semi-urban outlet with steady business, was often praised for its “smooth functioning.” The Branch Manager, Mr. Raghav Mishta, trusted his small team deeply and he had a relaxed style. He delegated heavily to his Cash Officer, Suhail Sharma, whom he trusted implicitly. Suhail was well-liked for his easy confidence and smooth efficiency. Suhail often surprised the team with small gestures—ordering refreshments on busy days or bringing gifts for colleagues at the branch, whenever he came back after a vacation. These thoughtful actions, paired with his helpful nature, kept everyone’s morale high and gave them comfort. Over time, small deviations from procedure became acceptable because nothing had ever gone wrong. Most processes were followed, but many checks slowly shifted into informal shortcuts. Gold loan packets were stored in the strong room under joint custody, but over time, Suhail often handled strong room activities alone. Strong room keys were handled informally, cash retention limits were occasionally exceeded “for convenience,” and operational checks were sometimes postponed due to workload. The controllers had not visited the branch for months, and the absence of complaints or reports created a false sense of security and the Branch Manager believed the absence of flags meant the branch was doing well.

The branch Associate, Ms. Aarti, worked closely with Suhail and often went to his seat to refer to locker register and sometimes for getting her queues authorised. She was efficient but had grown accustomed to the easy-going style of the branch. One afternoon, while placing vouchers on Suhail’s table, she noticed a thick sealed envelope in his personal bag. When she casually asked about it, he joked that it contained some old training papers. She hesitated for a moment, wondering why he brought such material to the branch, but she did not want to appear suspicious or rude. She quietly returned to her work.

Meanwhile, the branch messenger, Harish, was responsible for escorting customers, delivering letters, and helping with small tasks. He noticed that two unfamiliar men had been visiting Suhail quite regularly. They often came during late afternoons and waited near the cash officer’s counter. Their behaviour was slightly unusual—they never approached other counters and seemed comfortable walking straight toward Suhail. Harish considered asking Suhail about them but assumed these must be acquaintances or perhaps vendors connected to the branch.

The branch guard, Mukhtar Singh, also found their presence odd. Their visits did not match normal customer patterns. Sometimes they arrived close to branch closing time and walked inside with a confidence that made Mukhtar wonder how well they knew the staff. Yet he never raised the issue with the Branch Manager, thinking it was not his place to interfere in staff matters.

At the Regional Business Office, Chief Manager Compliance, Dharmendra Rao, was responsible for periodic branch visit to check and verify the loan records of the branch. However, due to work pressure and travel constraints, he kept postponing his visits and instead relied on quick phone calls. During these calls, he checked the branch’s position verbally and was reassured by the Branch Manager Mr. Raghav Mishta’s confident updates. With no significant alerts appearing in MIS, he felt there was no urgency to physically inspect the branch.

For several months, the branch continued functioning on this foundation of informal trust. Cash retention levels occasionally exceeded the limits because Suhail told that he needed buffer cash for “peak customer days.” CCTV cameras in the branch had a slightly blurry feed. The vendor had recommended changing the cameras as they were very old and had low resolution. Mr. Mishta had yet to send the estimate to the RBO for approval. Gold loan packets were stored and retrieved by Suhail without the second officer being present every time.

Everything looked normal—except that the “normal” was slowly drifting away from the standards required in a high-risk banking environment.

The situation changed dramatically when the auditor arrived at the branch for RFIA. There appeared to be some mismatch in Gold Loans, but no one expected anything major. After all,
they believed their branch was functioning smoothly.

When the physical verification of gold loan packets began, the auditor discovered that several packets were missing. Suhail attempted to explain, but it did not make any sense. The CCTV footage did not show Suhail depositing the gold packets in the strong room on the dates of loans sanctioned. Once the footage was further checked, it became clear that there had been late-evening access to the strong room when only Suhail was present. The footage also captured that Suhail grew visibly uneasy whenever the unfamiliar visitors arrived, slipping into the strong room and later handing them small packets with deliberate secrecy. This pattern appeared on more than one occasion. It was later established that Suhail had accumulated significant debt due to persistent financial indiscipline. Cash verification also revealed a shortage beyond any explanation. Further cash shortage was detected when the branch ATM was verified. ATM replenishment records showed OTP usage even when the Branch Manager was not present, contradicting the joint custody requirement. As the auditor questioned the staff, the missing pieces of the puzzle surfaced. Aarti admitted she had seen the sealed envelope in Suhail’s bag. Harish and Mukhtar confirmed the frequent visits of the unknown individuals. Mr. Rao acknowledged he had not visited the branch physically for months. While all this unravelled, Mr. Raghav Mishta stood shocked, perplexed and baffled.
