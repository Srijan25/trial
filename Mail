CASELET
The Forgotten Fixed Deposit in Rajkot 
Moderators :  Smt Jyotsana SSharma, CM (Faculty), SBSC, Hyderabad 
 

In 2009, Mrs. Shalini Desai, a homemaker from Rajkot, invested her savings into a fixed deposit at her neighbourhood bank branch. At the time, she intended it to be a safe cushion for future needs. However, as the years passed, she became increasingly occupied with household responsibilities, caring for her family, and managing daily life. As a result, she neither renewed the fixed deposit upon its maturity nor carried out any transactions that would keep the account active. 

The deposit matured in 2019, but since there were no customer-induced transactions for a continuous period of ten years, the bank—following the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) guidelines—classified the deposit as “unclaimed.” Consequently, the balance was transferred to a fund created by RBI to protect dormant money and promote financial literacy.

In 2022, while reviewing his late mother’s financial history, Mrs. Desai’s son visited the branch to enquire about any old or forgotten accounts. Using the UDGAM portal, an online platform introduced by RBI to help customers search for unclaimed deposits across multiple banks, he discovered that his mother’s fixed deposit had indeed been transferred to the DEAF account due to prolonged inactivity.

The bank staff guided him through the reclaiming process. Once all documents were verified and the branch was satisfied with the legitimacy of the claim, the bank processed the request. The account was reactivated for settlement purposes, and the due amount—which included principal plus interest (as mandated by RBI for unclaimed interest-bearing deposits transferred to the DEAF)—was credited to the legal heir.
