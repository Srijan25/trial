Introduction 

This case study traces the poignant journey of Lily Mehra, a Canadian resident who, years after surviving a tragic accident, uncovers an unclaimed deposit left behind by her late father in a foreign travel card. Through the Reserve Bank of India’s Depositor Education and Awareness Fund (DEA Fund) and the UDGAM portal, Lily reconnects with a legacy of love and foresight. The case highlights the emotional power of financial recovery, the importance of regulatory transparency, and the human impact of dormant deposit outreach.

 

The Tragedy That Changed Everything 

In June 2011, Raj Mehra, his wife Sunita, and their 15-year-old daughter Lily arrived in Ahmedabad to attend a family wedding from Canada. It was a brief visit, filled with laughter, rituals, and reunions. On the morning of travel, as they rushed to catch their Air India flight back to Canada, Sunita called out, “Come on Lily, be quick!”—her voice echoing with urgency and affection. 

Hours later, news channels flashed the unthinkable: the flight had crashed en route, claiming 240 lives. Lily was the sole survivor out of all. After recovery, she was flown back to her maternal grandmother’s home in India, where grief hung heavy. A month later, Lily returned to Canada to live with her aunt, resuming her studies and slowly rebuilding her life. 

 

A New Chapter, A Hidden Legacy 

Years passed. Lily grew into a resilient, thoughtful woman. In 2022, now Lily aged 26 years, she married Rohit Sharma, an Indian-origin tech consultant based in Canada. During a visit to Rohit’s family home in Ahmedabad, Lily visited her childhood home in Ahmedabad—a place that had remained locked and untouched since the passing of her Grandmother, years ago. Dust hung in the air as she opened the creaking door, memories rushing back with every step. At the entrance, lying on the floor beneath a faded welcome mat, she noticed an envelope—yellowed with age, addressed to her late father, Raj Mehra. It was from a bank. 

Inside was a letter dated 2021, notifying Raj about the inactivity on his foreign travel card and the impending transfer of the balance to the RBI’s Depositor Education and Awareness (DEA) Fund. The letter mentioned the reclaim process and urged the account holder to act before the transfer. Lily’s hands trembled as she read it. She remembered how her father had closed most of his Indian accounts before their trip, transferring nearly ₹20 lakhs to the travel card for use in Canada. After the crash, the card was not traced, and account was already closed. She checked the UDGYAM portal, which was mentioned in the letter. 

The Reclaim Process: From Compliance to Compassion 

With Rohit’s support, Lily contacted the issuing bank. She submitted the required KYC documents, including her passport, address proof, and legal heir declaration. The bank conducted due diligence and verified the claim. Within weeks, Lily received ₹28.4 lakhs—original principal plus accrued interest at 4.5%—credited at the prevailing exchange rate. 

But for Lily, it was a message from her parents, a silent act of love preserved in financial form. “It felt like a blessing,” she said, “as if my parents had left behind a safety net I never knew existed.”

 

Strategic and Emotional Impact 

This case underscores several key takeaways: 

Regulatory foresight matters: The DEA Fund and UDGAM portal enabled a seamless, transparent reclaim process. 

Dormant deposits carry emotional weight: Outreach efforts must be sensitive, especially when linked to deceased customers. 

Financial legacy is personal: For Lily, the reclaimed deposit wasn’t just a transaction, but it was closure, connection, and continuity.

Lily used part of the funds to establish a small scholarship in her parents’ name at her former school in Canada. She invested the rest in a joint savings plan with Rohit, earmarked for their future child’s education. 

She later wrote to the bank and the RBI, thanking them for the initiative. “You didn’t just return money,” she wrote, “you returned memories, dignity, and a piece of my childhood.”
